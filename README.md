# HemiPopMiner
This repo contains script(s) to compliment the execution of hemi pop miner.

Hemi CLI Pop miner is prone to fail due to RPC failure(network congestion or server intermittent issues, could be anything) and/or sometimes the gas fee that is set is just enough. To fix this I have a small script here, this is V1, nothing fancy, just some basic bash code making use of the mempool testnet API. If you guys want to educate yourself with all the available btc testnet APIs, checkout https://mempool.space/testnet/api.
