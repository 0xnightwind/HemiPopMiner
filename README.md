# HemiPopMiner
This repo contains script(s) to compliment the execution of hemi pop miner.

Hemi CLI Pop miner often suffers network congestion or server intermittent due to overloaded mempool making the POP_STATIC_FEE that is set unable to mine any keystones. We cannot do much from out end apart from making sure to keep up with the changing fees but it’s a tedious task to keep monitoring it 24x7, hence I’ve build this script that changes the fees every 8 hours.
